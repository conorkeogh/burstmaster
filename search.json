The trigger signal remains at 0V when not stimulating and generates square-wave pulses at 5V for 25\\(\\mu\\)s to trigger the target stimulator.\nThe input device must therefore tolerate a 5V input. Most stimulation systems will be triggered by a rising edge, making the duration of the trigger pulse unimportant. However, some electrophysiological recording systems require a trigger pulse of a fixed duration to trigger. 25\\(\\mu\\)s is sufficient to trigger most commercial recording systems without excessively limiting the maximum achievable stimulation frequency."

This should be connected to the trigger input of the recording system.\nIn normal and high frequency modes, a synchronisation pulse is sent on every trigger pulse, while in burst mode a synchronisation pulse is sent only on the first pulse of each burst. This allows recording to be synchronised to the start of each burst, rather than activating the recording system on every pulse within a burst.\nMost commercial EMG systems use a falling-edge signal to trigger recording. The synchronisation signal is therefore held at 5V. When sending a synchronisation pulse, the output is pulled down to 0V for 25\\(\\mu\\)s. This will trigger recording.\nNote that EMG systems vary in the format and pinout of their trigger connectors. This may therefore require a custom cable, e.g. a BNC to 9-pin sub-D connector cable, to connect the synchronisation signal output to the correct input pin on the target recording system.\nExamples of the synchronisation output for each stimulation type are shown in the triggering section.\n\n\n\n\nOxford Neural Interfacing 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOxford Neural Interfacing 2023"
